# Data_Linkage_And_Classification
My Data_Linkage and Classification Project

## Main skills used in this project
+ Data Linkage on the stocks of Google and Amazon based on their name, description and price
+ Using the library like `fuzzywuzzy` and `textdistance` for the data linkage
+ Using the idea of **Blocking** to make the linkage part more efficient and with higher accuracy
+ Comparing three the accuracy difference Classsfication Algo, `decision tree`, `k-nn(n = 5)` and `k-nn(n = 10)`
+ Feature engineering and selection
  + Interaction term pairs and Clustering label
  + Principal Component Analysis
  + Naive choosing the first four features
